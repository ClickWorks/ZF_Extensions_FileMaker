FileMaker PHP API files should be copied here.

Because of different versions depending on the FileMaker versions, and licensing restrictions we cannot provide them ourselves.

The directory layout here would be so that this directory contains a file name 'FileMaker.php' and a  folder named 'FileMaker'.
